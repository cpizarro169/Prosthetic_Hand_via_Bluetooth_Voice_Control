# Prosthetic_Hand_via_Bluetooth_or_Voice_Control

    Control servo motors with either a PS4 remote via bluetooth or by voice commands.
    These motors are connected to a 3D printed prosthetic hand and controls changes its postion/gesture.
    
    Code was orginally generated by EasyVR Commander based on voice commands we have created 
    in sepearte groups. After analyzing the default code, many variables and cases were removed.
    Parts that remained in the code have been marked and have not been touced since it is
    used as part of running the easyVR module.
    The rest of the code is created by Christian Pizarro and Jose Aquino.

    Can be used on Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega 2560.
